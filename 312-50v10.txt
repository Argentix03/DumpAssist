How does the Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) work?
A. It sends a request packet to all the network elements, asking for the MAC address from a specific IP.
B. It sends a reply packet to all the network elements, asking for the MAC address from a specific IP.
C. It sends a reply packet for a specific IP, asking for the MAC address.
D. It sends a request packet to all the network elements, asking for the domain name from a specific IP.
Answer: A
Explanation:
When an incoming packet destined for a host machine on a particular local area network arrives at a gateway, the gateway asks the ARP program to find a
physical host or MAC address that matches the IP address. The ARP program looks in the ARP cache and, if it finds the address, provides it so that the packet
can be converted to the right packet length and format and sent to the machine. If no entry is found for the IP address, ARP broadcasts a request packet in a
special format to all the machines on the LAN to see if one machine knows that it has that IP address associated with it. A machine that recognizes the IP address
as its own returns a reply so indicating. ARP updates the ARP cache for future reference and then sends the packet to the MAC address that replied.

What is the benefit of performing an unannounced Penetration Testing?
A. The tester will have an actual security posture visibility of the target network.
B. Network security would be in a "best state" posture.
C. It is best to catch critical infrastructure unpatched.
D. The tester could not provide an honest analysis.
Answer: A
Explanation:
Real life attacks will always come without expectation and they will often arrive in ways that are highly creative and very hard to plan for at all. This is, after all,
exactly how hackers continue to succeed against network security systems, despite the billions invested in the data protection industry.
A possible solution to this danger is to conduct intermittent “unannounced” penentration tests whose scheduling and occurrence is only known to the hired
attackers and upper management staff instead of every security employee, as would be the case with “announced” penetration tests that everyone has planned
for in advance. The former may be better at detecting realistic weaknesses.

The data obtained by a Heartbleed attack may include unencrypted exchanges between TLS parties likely to be confidential, including any form post data in users'
requests. Moreover, the confidential data exposed could include authentication secrets such as session cookies and passwords, which might allow attackers to
impersonate a user of the service.
An attack may also reveal private keys of compromised parties. References: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Heartbleed

env x=`(){ :;};echo exploit` bash -c 'cat /etc/passwd'
What is the Shellshock bash vulnerability attempting to do on a vulnerable Linux host?
A. Display passwd content to prompt
B. Removes the passwd file
C. Changes all passwords in passwd
D. Add new user to the passwd file
Answer: A
Explanation:
To extract private information, attackers are using a couple of techniques. The simplest extraction attacks are in the form:
() {:;}; /bin/cat /etc/passwd
That reads the password file /etc/passwd, and adds it to the response from the web server. So an attacker injecting this code through the Shellshock vulnerability
would see the password file dumped out onto their screen as part of the web page returned.

You have successfully compromised a machine on the network and found a server that is alive on the same network. You tried to ping it but you didn't get any
response back.
What is happening?
A. ICMP could be disabled on the target server.
B. The ARP is disabled on the target server.
C. TCP/IP doesn't support ICMP.
D. You need to run the ping command with root privileges.
Answer: A
Explanation:
The ping utility is implemented using the ICMP "Echo request" and "Echo reply" messages.
Note: The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is one of the main protocols of the internet protocol suite. It is used by network devices, like routers, to send
error messages indicating, for example, that a requested service is not available or that a host or router could not be reached.

Answer: A
Explanation:
In computer science, a zombie is a computer connected to the Internet that has been compromised by a hacker, computer virus or trojan horse and can be used to
perform malicious tasks of one sort or another under remote direction. Botnets of zombie computers are often used to spread e-mail spam and launch denial-ofservice attacks. Most owners of zombie computers are unaware that their system is being used in this way. Because the owner tends to be unaware, these
computers are metaphorically compared to zombies. A coordinated DDoS attack by multiple botnet machines also resembles a zombie horde attack.

In 2007, this wireless security algorithm was rendered useless by capturing packets and discovering the passkey in a matter of seconds. This security flaw led to a
network invasion of TJ Maxx and data theft through a technique known as wardriving.
Which Algorithm is this referring to?
A. Wired Equivalent Privacy (WEP)
B. Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA)
C. Wi-Fi Protected Access 2 (WPA2)

A regional bank hires your company to perform a security assessment on their network after a recent data breach. The attacker was able to steal financial data
from the bank by compromising only a single server.
Based on this information, what should be one of your key recommendations to the bank?
A. Place a front-end web server in a demilitarized zone that only handles external web traffic
B. Require all employees to change their passwords immediately
C. Move the financial data to another server on the same IP subnet
D. Issue new certificates to the web servers from the root certificate authority
Answer: A
Explanation:
A DMZ or demilitarized zone (sometimes referred to as a perimeter network) is a physical or logical subnetwork that contains and exposes an organization's
external-facing services to a larger and untrusted network, usually the Internet. The purpose of a DMZ is to add an additional layer of security to an organization's
local area network (LAN); an external network node only has direct access to equipment in the DMZ, rather than any other part of the network.

Port scanning can be used as part of a technical assessment to determine network vulnerabilities. The TCP XMAS scan is used to identify listening ports on the
targeted system.
If a scanned port is open, what happens?
A. The port will ignore the packets.
B. The port will send an RST.
C. The port will send an ACK.
D. The port will send a SYN.
Answer: A
Explanation:
An attacker uses a TCP XMAS scan to determine if ports are closed on the target machine. This scan type is accomplished by sending TCP segments with the all
flags sent in the packet header, generating packets that are illegal based on RFC 793. The RFC 793 expected behavior is that any TCP segment with an out-ofstate Flag sent to an open port is discarded, whereas segments with out-of-state flags sent to closed ports should be handled with a RST in response. This
behavior should allow an attacker to scan for closed ports by sending certain types of rule-breaking packets (out of sync or disallowed by the TCB) and detect
closed ports via RST packets.

The configuration allows a wired or wireless network interface controller to pass all traffic it receives to the central processing unit (CPU), rather than passing only
the frames that the controller is intended to receive.
Which of the following is being described?
A. promiscuous mode
B. port forwarding
C. multi-cast mode
D. WEM
Answer: A
Explanation:
Promiscuous mode refers to the special mode of Ethernet hardware, in particular network interface cards (NICs), that allows a NIC to receive all traffic on the
network, even if it is not addressed to this NIC. By default, a NIC ignores all traffic that is not addressed to it, which is done by comparing the destination address
of the Ethernet packet with the hardware address (a.k.a. MAC) of the device. While this makes perfect sense for networking, non-promiscuous mode makes it
difficult to use network monitoring and analysis software for diagnosing connectivity issues or traffic accounting.

Application layer firewalls are responsible for filtering at 3, 4, 5, 7 layer. Because they analyze the application layer headers, most firewall control and filtering is
